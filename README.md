# Chess Opening Trainer
A simple web app to train the first moves of chess openings like Italian Game, Spanish Game, etc. against a bot. <br /> 
The frontend was my first React.js project. The UI isn't fancy at all but it works on mobile screens to what made me pretty proud at this time. <br />
The Spring Boot Backend and the Dockerization where added later.
